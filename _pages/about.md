I am a recent graduate with a M.S. in statistics from [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). Before, I obtained my B.Sc degree in statistics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), in 2021.

My research interests lie in causal representation learning and causality-inspired GNNs. I am actively seeking Ph.D. / RA / internship positions in the related fields in Fall 2024 / Spring 2025.
