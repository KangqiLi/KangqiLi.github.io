## About Me

I recently graduated with a M.S. degree in Statistics from [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Statistics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I am currently working on a survey on **causal reasoning with LLMs** under the guidance of [Prof. Jing Ma](https://jma712.github.io/).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie broadly in topics related to causal inference and machine learning, as well as their combination, including: 

- Causality Inspired Trustworthy ML
- Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization
- Graph Foundation Models
- Causal Reasoning in NLP

I am actively seeking Ph.D. / RA positions in the related fields in 2025. Please feel free to contact me at [kangqiliCWRU@gmail.com](kangqiliCWRU@gmail.com) if you are interested in discussing with me.
