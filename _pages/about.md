I am a recent graduate with a M.S. degree in statistics from [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). Before, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in statistics from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), in 2021.

My research interests lie broadly in topics related to causal inference and machine learning, including: 
- Causality Inspired Trustworthy ML
- Causal Representation Learning
- Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization
- Causal LLMs, recently

I am actively seeking Ph.D. / RA / internship positions in the related fields in 2024 / 2025.
