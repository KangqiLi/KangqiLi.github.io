I'm a second-year graduate student in statistics at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), slated to obtain my master's degree in Spring 2024. Before, I obtained my bachelor's degree in statistics at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I'm interested in casual inference and its connection to machine learning. Currently, I am doing individual research on causal generative models under the supervision of professor Jing Ma from [Department of Computer and Data Sciences](https://engineering.case.edu/computer-and-data-sciences). I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions in the interdisciplinary field of causal inference and machine learning in Fall 2024 / Spring 2025.
